Hi, I'm just a 17 year old guy, who is learning to code on many programming languages.

ğŸ“—ğŸ“˜ğŸ“™ Current progress: ğŸ“—ğŸ“˜ğŸ“™

- Visual Basic -> Currently learning, really new language for me.
- Pascal -> Learned quite a lot of it, although it isn't that useful in my eyes.
- Python -> I'm yet to learn Python, since it seems really interesting and useful.
- (etc)

ğŸ“—ğŸ“˜ğŸ“™ ----------------- ğŸ“—ğŸ“˜ğŸ“™

All of the repositories I publish are just for learning purposes, I'd be happy if anyone is willing to test them out and make a constructive opinion on them. 
That opinion could include what should I get better at, what could I add, some rendudancies that I could have possibly have made, etc.
